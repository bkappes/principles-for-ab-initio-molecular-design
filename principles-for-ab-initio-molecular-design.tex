%% ---------------
%% Each author should be given as a separate \author command.
%%
%% Corresponding authors should have an e-mail given after the author
%% name as an \email command. Phone and fax numbers can be given
%% using \phone and \fax, respectively; this information is optional.
%%
%% The affiliation of authors is given after the authors; each
%% \affiliation command applies to all preceding authors not already
%% assigned an affiliation.
%%
%% The affiliation takes an option argument for the short name.  This
%% will typically be something like "University of Somewhere".
%%
%% The \altaffiliation macro should be used for new address, etc.
%% On the other hand, \alsoaffiliation is used on a per author basis
%% when authors are associated with multiple institutions.

\section{Introduction}\paragraph{Ab initio design}% Difficult% Prediction from direct calculations
\paragraph{Prediction from groups of molecules}
% Matt’s paper% Lei’s paper% Hutchinson’s papers% Kitchin’s papers% Nørskov’s papers
\paragraph{Predicting molecular properties is difficult but important}% Correlations require large datasets of relatively inexpensive quantum calculations where the dataset is expensive to calculate% Correlations are often true on for a specific domain of chemistry but are not general
% Properties are often a function of many variables%% Substructures %%% Number of constituents%%% Identity of constituents%%% Relative substituent positions

\paragraph{Most large datasets are currently used to screen based on heuristics}% Screening can find candidates but gives no information about what improves properties% While the desired properties are usually known the mapping of calculated values is properties is often unknown and system as designed ad hoc to produce the desired data

\paragraph{We have a framework for mapping molecular properties to functional groups and substructures (Fingerprints)}

\paragraph{Case study: Liquid and Semi-liquid batteries}% A possible solution for grid and EV energy storage % Require molecules with precise properties%% Electrochemical window%% Low MW%% Good solubility% Properties can be difficult and expensive to measure
\section{Computational methods}\paragraph{Creating the dataset}% Calculation of properties%% Global optimization using FF%% Quantum optimization%% Solvation energy%% Electrochemical window%% Other properties
\paragraph{Using the dataset for screening}% Properties can be enumerated % Plotting simple properties%% Substituted values plotted against changes in properties%%% Functional groups (F, Cl, CN, CF3, CH3, t-butyl, OCH3)%%% Properties (Solvation, 1st and 2nd Redox Potentials)%%% 3D plot of all of these%% Quantification of changes due to functional group addition
\paragraph{Infrastructure for making prediction from the dataset}% Fingerprinting of molecules in the dataset%% Conversion to bit strings% Measuring differences from a reference using bit strings%% Tanimoto% Clustering of fingerprints vs. properties (Solvation, 1st and 2nd Redox Potentials)%% K-means of 3% Classification%% Property vectors %% Bit strings for FP% Mapping substring contributions to a property

\section{Results and Discussion}\paragraph{Property calculations}% Experimental theoretical correlation for redox potentials%Cite previous work% Description of property changes upon functionalization
\paragraph{Solvation}% Changes%% Number of constituents%% Identity of constituents%% Relative substituent positions% Quantitative model of the effect of functionalization on solvation

\paragraph{Redox potentials}% Changes based on the %% Number of constituents%% Identity of constituents%% Relative substituent positions% Quantitative model of the effect of functionalization on redox potentials% How to improve anodes and cathodes
